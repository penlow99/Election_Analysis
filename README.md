# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorada Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.7, Visual Studio Code 1.49.2

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were **369,711** votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
    - **Charles Casper Stockham**
    - **Diana DeGette**
    - **Raymon Anthony Doane**
- The candidate results were:
    - **Charles Casper Stockham** received **23.0%** of the vote and **85,213** number of votes.
    - **Diana DeGette** received **73.8%** of the vote and **272,892** number of votes.

## Challenge Overview
This challenge presented us with the problem of reading in a data file in the csv format (election_results.csv), and performing an analysis on that data. Once the correct analysis had been run, the formatted results were to be saved to text file (election_analysis.txt) and printed to the screen via the terminal VS Code.

## Challenge Summary
Using the results from this election, a total of votes was tallied for each candidate. As can been seen in the analysis of this election, Diana DeGette won by a handy margin. She received more than double the votes of her competetors combined total. A breakout of the results can be found in the "election_analysis,txt" file store in the "Analysis" folder.
